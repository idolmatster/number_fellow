### Hi so if you want this bot eh?   
Well that's cool but you sadly gonna need to host it yourself.   
   
I'm not going to give you a step by step guide since that might be outdated quick.   
So here are some of the most important things you need to know.   
- this bot is made in nodejs
- this bot used discord.js and nhentai-api and a moded version of my nhentai-api "wraper"
- the bot token goes into the bot_config, a sample is provided so you don't need to figure out what things are called.
- all settings are global and set in settings filed under ../src/settings.

## more infos
- bot_n-hentai_settings contains settings for n-hentai related stuff
  - there are some random settings like if you want to have random searches filtered or if they need to be english
  - true means these filters are active and false means that they are not active. Be sure to adjust the settings before stating the bot
- random filters 
  - these are in n-hentai_settings and you can add what you want and remove what you want.
- bot repsonses
  - these are in bot_responses
  - currently on a message that will be sent to the user when you dm the bot.
